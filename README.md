# ReflectAPI
![](https://jitpack.io/v/yacinehamza111/ReflectAPI.svg)

an API plugin that makes it easy to make plugins!


To add **ReflectAPI** to your plugin, add the following code below:

```xml
<repository>
	<id>jitpack.io</id>
	<url>https://jitpack.io</url>
</repository>
```

```xml
<dependency>
	<groupId>com.github.yacinehamza111</groupId>
	<artifactId>ReflectAPI</artifactId>
	<version>Tag</version>
</dependency>
```

Replace the `Tag` with the current version which is in the jitpack badge.




To make a command using **ReflectAPI** to your plugin, you have to make a package called `commands`, when you are done making it. Make a new class called `<commandname>Comnmand` (replace the `<commandname>` with the command your gonna make)
